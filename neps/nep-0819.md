Status: Draft
Type: Standard

## Summary
NEP 819 is a helper function designed to support the standard for burning NFTs.

currently there is no standard for minting and burning (NEP 171), but there is NEP 297 which handles NFT events of (nft_mint, nft_tansfer, and nft_burn)

## Motivation
As the Near Ecosystem NFTs are starting to evolve from simply being unique records with a pointer to metadata into being real world assets that can be interacted with for goods and services, the NFT standards should also evolve to more efficiently support developers as they build their projects.

Having a variety of methods for burning NFTs adds unnecessary complexity. (this should be standardized)
Having no standard for burning “utlity NFTs” makes it more difficult to NFT owners across the Near ecosystem to keep an efficient record of how they are using their NFTs.

## Rationale and Alternatives
While there are projects that handle burning NFTs at the application layer, which provides useful functionality for real world usecases of NFTs (NFT tickets for examle), there is no standard.

Handling non-utility NFT burns at the application layer solves the purpose of removing unwanted non-fungible token data from future Near Protocol blocks, but does not address the need for a “receipt” when an NFT owner decides to burn their NFT to receive a good or service.


## Specification

## Reference Implementation

## Security Implications
Ensure that when a user calls “utility_nft_burn” (nft_burn with helper function “on_burn”) the associated contract an handle the error if there is no on_burn function implemented.

## Drawbacks
NFT protocols would have to upgrade their contracts to add these burn features. This may cause initial confusion between protocols that apply this standard and those that do not.

## Unresolved Issues


## Future possibilities
We believe that NEP 819 is the beginning of offering numerous on-chain flows upon burning. In the future, we would hope to extend the standard and build upon it to allow for more possibilities, such as:

- NFT evolution (wrap NFT in conract with counter. As counter > evolution value, utility_nft_burn)
- NFT reciepts (ticketing, coupons, memberships)
- More efficent on-chain gaming with the ability for collaboraative on-chain action.
